# My First ML Project

The project is using **FastTreeTweediefor** for training a decision tree regression model using **Tweedie** loss function. This trainer is a generalization of Poisson, compound Poisson, and gamma regression.

The project receive data for: *month*, *work days in month*, *type of task* and *count of tasks*, and makes prognosis about needed people to finish the task (**FPIs**)
